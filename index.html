            <p class="mb-5">
              Even though I started writing & producing my own songs just 5
              years ago; music has always been my therapy. My unique sound is
              influenced by my life experience as a classical dancer & as a
              late-diagnosed autistic female. Since my diagnosis; I've been
              using my little closet home recording studio to connect more
              openly with similar audiences. And for me, being a musician isn't
              just about being vocal or expressing a vibe ~it's about listening
              too.

            <p class="mb-5">
              Even though I started walking for high-end clothing companies some
              15 years ago; being center stage still feels like home to me. It's
              the one place where I have an excuse to be "weird", where I have
              an excuse to be me. On the daily, you can usually find me dressed
              in comfy-chic fashion. And for me, being a model isn't just about
              being pretty or repping a brand ~it's about transparency too.

            <p class="mb-5">
              Even though I started prioritizing my own mental health later in
              life, better late than never is what I say. Today, I'm so grateful
              to know how my neurodivergent brain works. Now that I have the correct
              tools to be sucessful in life; I can fight for the little one who
              couldn't ask questions. I can fight for the little one who was
              forced to hide. And for me, being an advocated isn't just about
              standing up for what's right or being brave ~it's about education too.
